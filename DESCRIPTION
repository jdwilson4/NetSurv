Description: This package is used to simulate and estimate a dynamic degree
    corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM), which has a structural change point.
    The function NetSurv can be used to estimate a change point in a dynamic
    sequence of graphs using the maximum likelihood estimators of the DCSBM.
